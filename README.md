Odometry code for VEX Robotics and Advanced Physics and Robotics.

Worked on a VEX robot with X drive to track it's position relative to the origin, and have it return to the starting point.

Used C++ to design and implement a field-oriented positioning system using odometry, enabling robots to accurately
navigate a 12ft x 12ft field autonomously amidst external interactions with other robots.

Leveraged git to allow for collaboration between 13 team members to work around multiple devices.

Engineered and programmed robots to work seamlessly with multiple subsystems such as object manipulation, terrain
traversal, and dynamic scoring mechanisms to enhance efficiency in both autonomous and driver-controlled modes.

Developed and fine-tuned PID controllers using C++ to ensure precision in movements across varying speeds using
feedback loops with motor encoders and third-party sensors to maintain accuracy during complex maneuvers.
